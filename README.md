This repository contains the **EcoScan Hybrid AI Model**, an advanced system that integrates **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)** using **SimCLR** with **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** via **DQN**. It was developed as part of the *Trash to Cash with Rebottle* platform ‚Äî a smart AI-powered recycling ecosystem.

## üöÄ Overview

The model aims to:
- Pseudo-label unlabeled waste images (plastic, glass, metal).
- Predict recyclability using SSL clustering.
- Optimize eco-point rewards with Reinforcement Learning.
- Provide real-time feedback on uploaded or scanned bottle images.

## üß† Architecture

### 1. **Self-Supervised Learning (SimCLR)**
- Learns visual representations without labels.
- Projects images into a latent space using contrastive loss.
- Achieved **84% clustering accuracy** on unlabeled recycling images.

### 2. **Reinforcement Learning (DQN)**
- Trained to assign eco-points based on recyclability confidence.
- Agent receives rewards for correct classification and point decisions.
- Achieved **88% reward accuracy** on high-confidence predictions.
